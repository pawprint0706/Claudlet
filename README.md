# claudlet 🐾

**English** | [한국어](README.ko.md)

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/claudlet)](https://pypi.org/project/claudlet/)

A tiny pixel creature that lives on your desktop and reacts to **Claude Code or
Codex CLI** in real time — it types while your agent works, waits when it needs you, celebrates
when it's done, and roams around while you code. Click it to bring the terminal
back to the front.

Drawn entirely in code — no image assets — so it's self-contained and original
(CC0 artwork).

## See it in action

Real desktop capture. Pets perch on the terminal titlebar, roam the desktop, doze
off (💤) between tasks, and clamber over whatever else is on screen.

### Agent companions

When Claude spawns **subagents**, a little hard-hatted sidekick trails your pet
for each one — a duckling chain that follows it around, mirrors what the
subagent is doing, and waves goodbye when its agent finishes.

Each companion wears a random hat so you can tell them apart:

## Install

Install with [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io) (an isolated app install — pulls the
deps, incl. `pyobjc-framework-Quartz` on macOS, and puts the `claudlet*`
commands on your PATH), then wire it into Claude Code and Codex CLI:

```bash
pipx install claudlet
claudlet-install      # registers both agents' hooks + claudlet skill (idempotent)
```

Check your version with `claudlet-version` (installed vs latest release). Update
to the newest **release** with `pipx upgrade claudlet && claudlet-install`, or to
the tip of **develop** (edge) with `pipx install --force "git+https://github.com/YeeDochi/Claudlet@develop" && claudlet-install`.
Either way, restart your agent session afterward so the new hooks + pet code load.
Codex CLI also requires a one-time review in `/hooks`: trust the claudlet entries,
then start or resume the session once more so its `SessionStart` hook can run.
Use `/claudlet update` in Claude Code or `$claudlet update` in Codex.

To uninstall, **order matters — unhook first, then remove the package.**
`claudlet-uninstall` is the *only* step that removes the hooks from
`~/.claude/settings.json` and `$CODEX_HOME/hooks.json` (normally
`~/.codex/hooks.json`); if you delete the package first, those hooks linger and
the agent keeps trying to run a `claudlet-hook` that no longer exists.

```bash
claudlet-uninstall        # stops pets, unregisters the hooks + /claudlet skill
                          #   (add --purge to also delete your config)
pipx uninstall claudlet   # only after the line above succeeds
```

<details><summary>If <code>claudlet-uninstall</code> isn't found, or you installed from source</summary>

**Command not found (common on Windows).** The `claudlet*` commands live in pipx's
bin directory; if it isn't on your PATH the shell can't find them. The fix:
```
pipx ensurepath        # add pipx's bin dir to PATH
```
Then **restart your terminal** and run `claudlet-uninstall` again. (`pipx list`
prints the exact install location if you'd rather run the script by full path.)

**Source install** (the `install.py` one-liner clones to `~/claudlet` — there's no
pip package to remove). Run the checkout's own script, then delete the folder:
```bash
python ~/claudlet/bin/claudlet-uninstall
rm -rf ~/claudlet                                   # Windows: rmdir /s "%USERPROFILE%\claudlet"
```

**Already removed the package without unhooking?** The hook entries are still in
the Claude/Codex hook files. Reinstall just long enough to unhook cleanly:
```
pipx install claudlet && claudlet-uninstall && pipx uninstall claudlet
```
or delete the `claudlet-hook` entries by hand from `~/.claude/settings.json` and
`$CODEX_HOME/hooks.json` (normally `~/.codex/hooks.json`).
</details>

<details><summary>Without pipx — one-line source install</summary>

Clones (or updates) to `~/claudlet`, installs deps, registers hooks + skill:
```bash
# Linux / macOS
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YeeDochi/Claudlet/master/install.py | python3 -
```
```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YeeDochi/Claudlet/master/install.py | python -
```

Unlike pipx, this does **not** put the `claudlet*` commands on your PATH — they
live in `~/claudlet/bin`. The hooks still work (the agents call them by full
path), but to run `claudlet`, `claudlet-config`, `/claudlet update`, etc.
yourself, add that dir to your PATH:
```bash
# Linux / macOS — add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc, then restart the shell
export PATH="$HOME/claudlet/bin:$PATH"
```
```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell) — persist for your user, then restart the terminal
setx PATH "$env:USERPROFILE\claudlet\bin;$env:PATH"
```
</details>

New Claude Code and Codex CLI sessions then auto-spawn a pet. Restart any already-running session
to pick up the hooks — or launch one now with `claudlet`.

Best on **KDE Plasma**. Perching on and riding windows also works on **Windows**
(Win32) and **macOS** (needs `pyobjc-framework-Quartz`, which the installer adds
automatically; the pet self-calibrates window coordinates at runtime) — all three
are hardware-verified. Elsewhere the window tricks switch off gracefully and the
pet just roams. See **[Platform support](docs/platform.md)**.

## What it shows

The creature's pose tracks what Claude is doing — editing, reading, calling MCP,
thinking, waiting on your input, celebrating (see the sheet above). In **auto /
bypass mode** it puts on a VR visor and cruises, with a per-tool variant for each
activity. It also **perches on and rides your windows** — walking along the top or
living inside — and clips/hides when the window it's on is covered or minimized.

When Claude runs **subagents**, a hatted **companion** appears for each one (up to
three) and trails the pet in a duckling chain, mirroring the subagent's activity
and leaving with a little celebration when it finishes — so you can see agent work
happening at a glance.

## Commands

`pipx install claudlet` puts these on your PATH:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `claudlet` | Launch a pet right now (standalone). |
| `claudlet-install` | Register hooks and the claudlet skill in Claude Code + Codex CLI. |
| `claudlet-uninstall` | Stop pets, unregister the hooks + skill, clean up (`--purge` also deletes your config). |
| `claudlet-config` | Show / scaffold / open the user config (`--path`, `init`, `open`). |
| `claudlet-version` | Show the installed version vs the latest PyPI release. |
| `claudlet-attach` | Attach a pet to the current Claude Code or Codex CLI session. |
| `claudlet-motion <name>` | Play a motion on running pets (`jump`, `wave`, … ; `stop`, `list`). |
| `claudlet-install-hooks` | Just the hooks half of `claudlet-install` (`--remove` to undo). |
| `claudlet-macos-diag` | Print raw macOS window coordinates (perch troubleshooting). |
| `claudlet-hook` | Internal — invoked by the coding agent's hooks, not by you. |

### The claudlet skill

`claudlet-install` links the skill into both agents. Invoke `/claudlet` in
Claude Code or `$claudlet` in Codex CLI:

The examples below use Claude Code's spelling; replace `/claudlet` with
`$claudlet` in Codex CLI.

- `/claudlet` — attach a pet to **this** session (so it reacts to the session's activity)
- `/claudlet standalone` — an unattached, decorative pet
- `/claudlet <motion>` — `jump` · `wave` · `sing` · `juggle` · `float` · `celebrate` · `thinking` · `sleeping` · `error` · `attention` (plus `list`, `stop`)
- `/claudlet config` — show the config, or just ask in plain language ("jump when I run Bash") and Claude edits it for you
- `/claudlet update` — update to the latest release (`update latest` for the tip of develop); shows your version and walks you through it
